If it is a data structure template, use class to describe. The file should be commented, which at least describes the data members and member functions.

If it is a algorithm template, use functions to describe. Every function should have a obvious name that easy to recognize what it use to do. The name of function follow the rule of the file name. Every variable and array should be commented.
