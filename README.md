# AlgorithmTemplateForAcm
An algorithm template preparing for ICPC competition. Any comments are welcome.

From Southern China University of Technology. (SCUT)

# Format of Files
The name of files will only include the lower-case letters and underlines.

Files name example: 
segment_tree.cpp

# Requirement for Codes
If it is a data structure template, use class to describe. The file should be commented, which at least describes the data members and member functions.

If it is a algorithm template, use functions to describe. You can use namespace to avoid conflict definition as well. Every function should have a obvious name that easy to recognize what it use to do. The name of function follow the rule of the file name. Every variable and array should be commented.
